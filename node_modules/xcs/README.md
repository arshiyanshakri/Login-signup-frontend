[AWS Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) is Amazons managed docker container orchestration service.

This tool offers a intuitive cli for every day operations over ECS. The idea is to mirror ECS resource structure to the file system. As navigating the file system is a breeze, navigating clusters, services and other resource types becomes a breeze as well.
